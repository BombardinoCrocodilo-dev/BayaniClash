# Bayani Clash

Bayani Clash is a 2D fighting game inspired by classic titles like Street Fighter, featuring Philippine heroes with unique abilities. This game is developed in Unity using C# as an IT capstone project.

## Game Features
- **Story Mode** – Choose any hero and fight through 10 stages. After finishing a hero's story (win or lose), the hero becomes temporarily locked and shows a W or L based on your result. Play through all heroes to complete their stories. Once all heroes are done, every character unlocks again, and your results are saved so you can replay for different outcomes.   
- **Player vs Player (PvP)** – Multiplayer battles implemented using **Netcode for GameObjects** for synchronization and multiplayer logic
- **Player vs Environment (PvE)** – Battle AI opponents with fixed difficulty and manually programmed behavior
